# Realtime Clock
> ðŸ•’ Show the current time where you live on an analogue clock in VRChat.

This clock uses VRC_Panorama for pulling your current time from the internet. It uses https://maki.cat for finding the current time with your IP address, therefore it can sometimes return an inaccurate location, which can cause the time to be offsetted by an hour or two. And fyi, I don't track anything from my HTTP GET requests... That would be mean...

You can change the background and foreground colours in the material and change
the numbers texture aswell. I kept the .ai file so you can change fonts easily.

## Thank you!
